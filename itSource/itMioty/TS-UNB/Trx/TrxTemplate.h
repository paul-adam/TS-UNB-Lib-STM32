1. INTRODUCTION

The Fraunhofer Telegram Splitting - Ultra Narrowband Library ("TS-UNB-Lib") is software
that implements only the uplink of the ETSI TS 103 357 TS-UNB standard ("MIOTY") for wireless 
data transmission in the field of IoT. Patent licenses for any patent claim regarding the 
ETSI TS 103 357 TS-UNB standard implementation (including those of Fraunhofer) may be 
obtained through Sisvel International S.A. 
(https://www.sisvel.com/licensing-programs/wireless-communications/mioty/license-terms)
or through the respective patent owners individually. The purpose of this TS-UNB-Lib is 
academic and non-commercial use. Therefore, Fraunhofer does not offer any support for the 
TS-UNB-Lib. Furthermore, the TS-UNB-Lib is NOT identical and on the same quality level as 
the commercially-licensed MIOTY software also available from Fraunhofer. Users are encouraged
to check the Fraunhofer website for additional applications information and documentation.

/**
 * @brief Implementation of burst transmission using the HopeRF RFM69HW
 *
 * This class implements the transmission of the radio bursts using the HopeRF RFM69HW
 * transmitter module. For this purpose the transmitter is switched into the continuous
 * transmission mode and the symbol clock is generated by the microcontroller.
 * The RFM69HW DIO2 pin is not used for the modulation. Consequently, the frequency deviation
 * is set to zeros. Instead this implementation directly changes the transmission frequency
 * for the modulation of the data.
 *
 * Depending on the actual transmitter module the template parameter BOOST_PIN must be set to true.
 * However, some modules do only support one of the modes. For transmit powers >13dBm the BOOST_PIN
 * must be always set to true, which requires the module to support it.
 *
 * The template parameter F_DEV defines the frequency deviation. The RFM69HW has a minimum step size of
 * exactly 61.03515625Hz. The required frequency deviation for the standard mode is 2380.371Hz / 4 =
 * 595.09275Hz, which cannot be achieved 61.03515625Hz. This would require a frequency deviation of 9.75.
 * Though, a frequency deviation of 10 (610.3515625Hz) results has shown to work properly. For other modes
 * the frequency deviation may be adjusted.
 *
 * The template class RadioBurst_T defines a radio burst data structure. The actual implementation has to
 * offer the methods: uint16_t getBurstLength(void), uint8_t* getBurst(void), uint16_t get_channel(void).
 *
 * At an early stage in the program the init() method shall be called. It brings the device into the sleep
 * mode to save energy. It is not part of the constructor to allow the user to start a watchdog before
 * calling the init() method.
 * 
 * @tparam		Cpu_T			Plattform depended implementation
