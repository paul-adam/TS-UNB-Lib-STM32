# TS-UNB 

Welcome to TS-UNB-Lib. It implements the standard ETSI TS 103 357 TS-UNB.  
The purpose of this TS-UNB-Lib is academic and non-commercial use. Therefore, Fraunhofer does
not offer any support for the TS-UNB-Lib. Furthermore, the TS-UNB-Lib is NOT identical and on 
the same quality level as the commercially-licensed MIOTY software also available from Fraunhofer.
Users are encouraged to check the Fraunhofer website for additional applications information and documentation.

The sample code is based on the STM32 code generated by STM32CubeIDE and thus does not contain any micro controller specific initialization code of peripherals (e. g.: SPI).

## Supported Devices

This library supports the devices listet below. The list of devices will be extended in the future.
### Systems
* This code supports all STM32 micro controller from STMicroelectronics as far as using HAL driver.


### Transceiver Chipsets
* HopeRF RFM69w
* HopeRF RFM69hw


## License
See the file [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md) for details on the software license for this library.

## Installation
Please set up the STM32CubeIDE and try the example.
